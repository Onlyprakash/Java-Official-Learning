File 1: Main.java

# 📘 FILE OVERVIEW :-

This is a comprehensive script covering the foundational building blocks of the Java language. It acts as a complete set of notes and examples for Java fundamentals, starting from the most basic data types and progressing to more complex topics like multi-dimensional arrays.

# 🚀 KEY FEATURES & CONCEPTS :-

➤ Data Types: Demonstrates all primitive types (int, char, boolean, etc.) and their ranges.

➤ Operators: Covers Arithmetic, Assignment, Increment/Decrement, and Bitwise operators.

➤ String Manipulation: Includes a wide range of essential String class methods.

➤ Control Flow: Implements conditional logic with if-else, switch-case, and logical operators.

➤ Loops: Provides examples of while, do-while, and for loops, including break and continue.

➤ Arrays: Explores 1D and 2D arrays, with algorithms for searching, finding max value, reversing, and summing elements.

# 🧠 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :-

➤ To understand and practice the basic syntax of Java.

➤ To learn how to declare variables and perform operations on them.

➤ To master controlling program flow using conditionals and loops.

➤ To become proficient in creating and manipulating arrays for data storage.

File 2: class.java

# 📘 FILE OVERVIEW :-

This file serves as a basic introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It demonstrates the fundamental concept of creating a "blueprint" (a class) and then creating actual instances from it (objects). The example uses an Employee class to model a real-world entity.

# 🚀 KEY FEATURES & CONCEPTS :-

➤ Class Definition: Shows how to create a custom class (Employee) from scratch.

➤ Attributes (Fields): Defines properties of the class, such as id, name, and Salary.

➤ Methods (Behaviors): Implements methods like printDetails() and getSalary() to perform actions.

➤ Object Instantiation: The test_class creates two distinct Employee objects, peter and John.

➤ State & Behavior: Demonstrates setting the state (attributes) of each object and then calling its methods.

# 🧠 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :-

➤ To understand the core difference between a class and an object.

➤ To learn how to define attributes and methods within a class.

➤ To practice creating new objects (instances) from a class using the new keyword.

➤ To understand how each object maintains its own separate state.

File 3: Practice_class.java

# 📘 FILE OVERVIEW :-

This file contains a collection of practical exercises that explore the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in greater depth. It moves beyond basic class creation to showcase how major OOP pillars like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Abstraction are implemented in Java.

# 🚀 KEY FEATURES & CONCEPTS :-

➤ Encapsulation: Demonstrated with Student and BankAccount classes, using private fields and public getters/setters to protect data.

➤ Inheritance: Showcased with Animal/Dog and Grandparent/Parent/Child hierarchies, using the extends and super() keywords.

➤ Abstraction: Implemented with an abstract class Pen and its concrete subclass FountainPen to hide implementation details.

➤ Practical Examples: Includes simple classes like cellPhone and Square to reinforce the concepts of methods and properties.

# 🧠 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :-

➤ To understand and implement Encapsulation to create secure and robust classes.

➤ To learn how to use Inheritance to build class hierarchies and promote code reuse.

➤ To grasp the concept of Abstraction for creating flexible and modular designs.

➤ To apply multiple OOP principles together to solve practical problems.

# 🛠️ TECHNOLOGIES USED :-

➤ Programming Language: Java

➤ IDE Support: IntelliJ IDEA

➤ Java Version: JDK 8 or above
